# Core Dimensions of Responsible AI

- **Fairness**  
    AI systems promote inclusion, prevent discrimination, uphold responsible values and legal norms, and build trust with society.  
    To create systems suitable and beneficial for all.  
- **Explainability**  
    Clearly explain or provide justification for its internal mechanisms and decisions so that it is understandable to humans.  
    Humans must understand how models are making decisions and address any issues of bias, trust, or fairness.
- **Privacy and security**  
    Data is protected from theft and exposure.  
    At a privacy level, individuals control when and if their data can be used.  
    At the security level, it verifies that no unauthorized systems or unauthorized users will have access to the individualâ€™s data.  
- **Transparency**  
    Transparency communicates information about an AI system so stakeholders can make informed choices about their use of the system. Some of this information includes development processes, system capabilities, and limitations.  
    It provides individuals, organizations, and stakeholders access to assess the fairness, robustness, and explainability of AI systems. They can identify and mitigate potential biases, reinforce responsible standards, and foster trust in the technology.  
- **Veracity and robustness**  
    AI system operates reliably, even with unexpected situations, uncertainty, and errors.  
    resilient to changes in input parameters, data distributions, and external circumstances.  
    retain reliability, accuracy, and safety in uncertain environments.  
- **Governance**  
    Governance is a set of processes that are used to define, implement, and enforce responsible AI practices within an organization.  
    Governance addresses various responsible, legal, or societal problems that generative AI might invite.  
    For example, governance policies can help to protect the rights of individuals to intellectual property.  
- **Safety**  
    development of algorithms, models, and systems in such a way that they are responsible, safe, and beneficial for individuals and society as a whole.  
    designed and tested to avoid causing unintended harm to humans or the environment. Things like bias, misuse, and uncontrolled impacts need to be proactively considered.  
- **Controllability**  
    ability to monitor and guide an AI system's behavior to align with human values and intent. It involves developing architectures that are controllable, so that any unintended issues can be managed and addressed.  
    helps mitigate risks, promote fairness and transparency, and ensure that AI systems benefit society as a whole.
