# DL Fundamentals

Involves the use of Artificial Neural Networks(ANN), which are computational models that are designed to mimic the way the human brain processes information.

## Neural networks
Core of Deep learning. Like neurons connected in brain, "nodes" are connected here.  
Nodes are organized into layers. The layers include an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer.

When we show a neural network many examples, like data about customers who bought certain products or used certain services, it figures out how to identify patterns by adjusting the connections between its nodes. It's like the nodes are talking to each other and slowly figuring out the patterns that separate different types of customers.  

Couple branches of AI where deep learning is used to enhance results:  
  - **Computer vision**: makes it possible for computers to interpret and understand digital images and videos.  
Deep learning has revolutionized computer vision by providing powerful techniques for tasks such as image classification, object detection, and image segmentation.  
  - **Natural language processing (NLP)**: interaction between computers and human languages  
Deep learning has made significant strides in NLP, making possible tasks such as text classification, sentiment analysis, machine translation, and language generation.
