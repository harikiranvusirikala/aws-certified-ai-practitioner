# Fundamentals of ML and AI

AI is a broad field that encompasses the development of intelligent systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as perception, reasoning, learning, problem-solving, and decision-making. AI serves as an umbrella term for various techniques and approaches, including machine learning, deep learning, and generative AI, among others.

ML is a type of AI for understanding and building methods that make it possible for machines to learn. These methods use data to improve computer performance on a set of tasks.

Deep learning uses the concept of neurons and synapses similar to how our brain is wired. An example of a deep learning application is Amazon Rekognition, which can analyze millions of images and streaming and stored videos within seconds.

Generative AI is a subset of deep learning because it can adapt models built using deep learning, but without retraining or fine tuning.  
Generative AI systems are capable of generating new data based on the patterns and structures learned from training data.
